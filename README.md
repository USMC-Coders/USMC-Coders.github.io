# This is Marine Coders website repo

We are a group of U.S. Marines who use code to improve the lives of our fellow Marines.

## Team Guidelines
* We build code to help Marines!
* We open source as much as possible [cio.gov](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/OSS/) [code.mil](https://code.mil)
* We are responsible users of existing open source code
* We help each other
